	// FROM TIME TO TIME THERE IS A STRANGE BUG THAT OCCURS ONLY WHEN THE GAME VIEW INS'T MAXIMISED ! 

	// SO IF YOU DO GET SOME RED ERRORS, JUST MAXIMISE ON PLAY AND THINGS SHOULD WORK SMOOTHLY !

	// OF COURSE THESE ERRORS WILL NOT EFFECT THE GAME ONCE IT HAS BEEN BUILT AND LAUNCHED :) !

	// IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY OTHER BUG TELL ME SO VIA DISCORD (LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION :) ) !

	 * Create empty game object with script "Room templates" and complete the variables
	 * Create rooms with empty objects for each exit, placed at the middle of the adjacent room location, with the script "Room spawner" attached
	 * Create empty at the middle of each room with the script "Destroyer"
	 */
